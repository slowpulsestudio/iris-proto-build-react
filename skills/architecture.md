# Architecture Rules

---

**Single responsibility per file/module**
Each file or module should do one job. Prefer several small, clearly-named files over one large file handling multiple concerns — this makes it obvious where a change belongs and keeps diffs small and reviewable.

**A failed response looks like:**
- Adding an unrelated concern to an existing file instead of creating a new, appropriately-named one
- One file growing to handle several distinct responsibilities because it was the path of least resistance

---

**Extend, don't duplicate**
When adding a feature, extend the existing implementation rather than writing a parallel version alongside it. Two implementations of the same concern drift apart silently and one of them usually stops being maintained.

**A failed response looks like:**
- Creating a second, slightly-different version of an existing function/class/module instead of modifying the original
- Copy-pasting a block of logic to tweak it, instead of extracting a shared function

---

**Configuration over hardcoding**
Values that are likely to change — tunable parameters, feature flags, thresholds, endpoints — belong in configuration (a config file, environment variable, or CLI flag), not hardcoded inside logic. Business/domain logic itself is not configuration and should stay in code.

**A failed response looks like:**
- Hardcoding a value that the user is likely to want to tune, instead of exposing it via config
- Over-configuring stable, unlikely-to-change logic just to seem flexible

---

**Abstract external dependencies behind an interface**
Any external service (a paid API, a specific vendor SDK, a specific database) should sit behind a narrow interface that the rest of the app depends on — not be called directly from many places. This is what makes a provider swappable later without a rewrite.

**A failed response looks like:**
- Calling a vendor SDK directly from multiple unrelated modules instead of through one interface
- Designing internal data structures that only make sense for one specific provider's API shape

---

**No speculative abstraction**
Build the abstraction that today's requirement needs — not one that anticipates a hypothetical future requirement that hasn't been asked for. Unused flexibility is a maintenance cost, not a benefit.

**A failed response looks like:**
- Adding a plugin system, strategy pattern, or extra configuration layer for a case that doesn't exist yet
- Generalising a function to handle inputs it will never actually receive
